# Azure CLI Nix Flake
I needed a more up-to-date version of az-cli than was available on nixpkgs-unstable, so this is a flake that (ostensibly) does that.

Most of the code is copied from what is maintained [here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixpkgs-unstable/pkgs/tools/admin/azure-cli/default.nix) and flake-ified for my machine.
